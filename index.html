          <h1>String Arrangements for Micah Wagner</h1>
          <h2>December 17th, 2014</h2>
          <div class="blog-image" style="background-image: url('images/stjude.jpg')"></div>
          <p>For the last several months, I've been playing guitar, keys, and singing backup vocals with the wonderful and talented <a href="http://micahwagner.com">Micah Wagner</a>, and his band, The Strange Rendezvous. Our work together continues into his second album, on which I'll be involved writing string and vocal arrangements, singing, and playing guitar. Check out his first album, Micah Wagner – 7 Years, 6 Months Late. Looking forward to sharing the new stuff with you in the coming months!</p>

          <h1>Austin Saxophone Ensemble performs American Counterpoint</h1>
          <h2>October 18th, 2014</h2>
          <div class="blog-image" style="background-image: url('images/austin-sax.jpg')"></div>
          <p>Whew! What a week : ) After an excellent concert Sunday by the Austin Saxophone Ensemble(featuring an excellent performance of American Counterpoint for Sax Quartet by Andy Wilds, Ben Kessler, Charlie Chadwell, and Nathan Mertens!), I had to double-time it writing and rehearsing guitar, piano, and string parts for a new song on an upcoming album, then took off Monday night, studio-bound. Tuesday and Wednesday flew by in the magical blur of recording, and we got some really good work done. Looking forward now to finishing up the album, and diving back into composition of a more classical-leaning nature!</p>

          <h1>Poor Shadows of Elysium's presents Shakespeare's Antony &amp; Cleopatra</h1>
          <h2>June, 2014</h2>
          <div class="blog-image" style="background-image: url('images/cleopatra.jpg')"></div>
          <p>Weekends in May were fun this year, as I got to join fellow UT musicians in providing a soundtrack to The Poor Shadows of Elysium's production of Shakespeare's too infrequently performed tragedy, Antony &amp; Cleopatra. Craig Sheffield (percussion), Eddie Hsu (ney), James Brian Griffith (oud, trumpet) and I (viola, percussion) played renditions of middle eastern folk songs, and improvised on themes we created for the show. Great fun! <a href="http://austinfusionmagazine.com/2014/05/30/poor-shadows-of-elysium-presents-antony-and-cleopatra/">Here</a>'s a review of the show from Austin Fusion Magazine.</p>

          <h1>Composition Recital</h1>
          <h2>April 26th, 2014</h2>
          <div class="blog-image" style="background-image: url('images/recital.jpg')"></div>
          <p>Finished up my tenure at UT's Butler School of Music with a wonderful composition recital, with excellent performances of three premiers. Helen Bravenec and Bob Lewis kicked the night off with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kO3zkg6zo0I">"A Silver Lining"</a> for violin and piano, then Page Stephens and Andrew Boss took us away with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJ4ZWBmmSA4&list=PLSu42vWEEXJ4-X8LrRqdtzxZPFvrl3abX">"Songs of Love &amp; Loss,"</a> a cycle of Emily Dickinson poems set for piano and voice. Last but not least, Andy Wilds, director of the Austin Saxophone Ensemble, led a quartet comprising ASE members Ben Kessler, Charlie Chadwell, and Nathan Mertens, in a rousing rendition of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNxLw3HOHtk&list=PLSu42vWEEXJ6AYuzXoxDt25ht4E7MoyZl">"American Counterpoint"</a> for sax quartet. They killed it, and brought the house down.</p>

          <div class="blog-image" style="background-image: url('images/wesley.jpeg')"></div>
          <p>Wesley Lunsford's album, So Much More, dropped on CDBaby, iTunes, and Spotify. He approached me during recording about string arrangements, which I provided for “I Lied” and “Bells &amp; Clicks.”  <a href="http://open.spotify.com/track/2POqpNQBLa4UADAgTgbsEc">Listen here</a>.</p>

          <h1>Multimedia Collaborated for Ears, Eyes, and Feet</h1>
          <h2>May 2-3, 2013</h2>
          <div class="blog-image" style="background-image: url('images/eyes-ears-feet.jpg')"></div>
          <p>Audrey Halm, Jared Broussard, and I saw our collaborative efforts come to fruition at the Ears, Eyes, and Feet performances of 2013. Wonderful work by dancers Chelsea Pribble, Angela Hurt, and Lucy Kerr, who realized Audrey's choreography with grace, skill, and heart. Jared is a beast on the trumpet, and Wailed away, bringing the live acoustic part of the piece to life. Excellent job by all involved. Premiers by Eli Fieldsteel, Ethan Greene, and many others rounded out a wonderful and successful night of student collaborations. <a href="https://soundcloud.com/davidcarltonadams/wail-20-282013-29">Listen here.</a></p>
